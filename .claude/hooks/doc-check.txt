DOC CHECK REQUIRED
==================

Before responding to implementation tasks, evaluate:

1. Check doc/ai/OVERVIEW.md for available documentation
2. Determine which docs are relevant to this request
3. Read those docs using the Read tool
4. Then respond to the user

This applies to coding tasks. Skip for simple questions or chat.
