COMMIT CHECK REQUIRED
=====================

Before stopping, check if you made code changes:

1. Run `git status` to see if there are uncommitted changes
2. Run cargo fmt to format all the code
3. If changes exist from your work, commit them NOW
4. Commit incrementally - each small working step, not one big commit
5. Run `just clippy` before committing to ensure no warnings
6. Remove any dead/unused code before committing

DO NOT wait for user to ask you to commit. Commit automatically.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use heredoc syntax (<<EOF) for commit messages.
Heredocs fail in sandbox mode because they need temp files.
Use simple quoted strings with embedded newlines instead:
  git commit -m "First line

  More lines here"
